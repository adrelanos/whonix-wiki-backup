=== Create Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs ===
<br />
This guide will create a new instance of a Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM, which routes all internet traffic through Tor, that you can then connect your Whonix-Workstation AppVMs to.

You can repeat this guide multiple times and create as many Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM instances as you need, for greater Tor isolation. Note that using multiple Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs simultaneously will reveal a pattern of connecting to multiple sets of Tor guard nodes, which may or may not be a unique usage indicator.


'''1. Create Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM'''

In Dom0 &raquo; Qubes VM Manager:

* Create a new VM:
** Name and label: Name your ProxyVM. Don't include any personal information. For example: "sys-whonix".
** Color: Choose a color label for your Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM.
** Use this template: Choose your Whonix-Gateway TemplateVM. For example: "whonix-gw-experimental".
** Standalone: Leave the Standalone field unchecked, unless you want a persistent root filesystem.
** Type: Choose the "ProxyVM" type.
** Allow networking: Choose your desired clearnet ServiceVM from the list. For example: "sys-firewall".
** Press: OK
