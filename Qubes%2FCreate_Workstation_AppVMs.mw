=== Create Whonix-Workstation AppVMs ===
<br />
This guide will create a new instance of a Whonix-Workstation AppVM, which serves as an AnonVM application environment, that you connect to Tor through a Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM of yours.

You can repeat this guide multiple times and create as many Whonix-Workstation AppVM instances as you need, for greater Tor and data isolation. You can connect multiple Whonix-Workstation AppVMs to the same or different instances of Whonix-Gateway ProxyVMs.


'''1. Create Whonix-Workstation AppVM'''

If connecting this AppVM to the internet, you will need an existing Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM instance to connect to. You may need to '''[[Qubes/Create_Gateway_ProxyVMs|create a Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM]]''' before proceeding.

In Dom0 &raquo; Qubes VM Manager:

* Create a new VM:
** Name and label: Name your AppVM. Don't include any personal information. For example: "whonix-workstation".
** Color: Choose a color label for your Whonix-Workstation AppVM.
** Use this template: Choose your Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM. For example: "whonix-workstation-gnome".
** Standalone: Leave the Standalone field unchecked, unless you want a persistent root filesystem.
** Type: Choose the "AppVM" type.
** Allow networking: Choose your desired Whonix-Gateway ProxyVM from the list. For example: "whonix-gateway".
** Press: OK



'''2. Edit Whonix-Workstation Firewall Rules'''

In Dom0 &raquo; Qubes VM Manager:

* Select Whonix-Workstation AppVM:
** Edit VM firewall rules:
*** Disable: Allow network access except...
*** Disable: Allow ICMP traffic
*** Disable: Allow DNS queries
*** Disable: Allow connections to Updates Proxy
