|description=Whonix Documentation. Crash Course in Anonymity and Security on the Internet.
}}
<languages />
This documentation is a crash course in anonymity and security on the Internet. Whonix is a technological means to anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem: No tool is enough to keep you safe.

Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest linkâ€”often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be. Fortunately, basic knowledge and caution will go far.
