Changelog:

* Tor 0.2.4

* obfs3 installed by default

* higher console resolution 1024x768 (without X)

* The current Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Alpha, which will soon become the
new TBB stable, will work out of the box in Whonix, even if you download
and install it manually from torproject.org. This is useful for the
case, that the Whonix Tor Browser updater breaks again, because
torproject.org changed something. Tor over Tor will be prevented.

* Graphical Whonix-Gateway. Optional. If you reduce Whonix-Gateway RAM
below 500 MB (this and every other aspect of this feature can be
configured), lets say to 128 MB, you automagically end up with the usual
non-graphical Whonix-Gateway.

* Whonix has now an updater. I can not promise, that you never have to
download a new image, when next stable version of Whonix gets released,
but we are on that way. Interested testers may have to download a new
(test-)image from time to time, since we also need to test the out of
the box user experience.

* First Time Connection Wizard: Whonix now comes with Tor disabled by
default and you have to run the Whonix First Time Connection Wizard,
called whonixsetup. You will get a notice, to do so. This is useful for
users who never want to connect to the public Tor network, because they
want to hide the fact, that they are using Tor. This kind of users can
now more easily set up (private) (obfuscated) bridges before ever trying
to connect to the Tor network.

* Fixed uwt. To do certain tasks such as installing the Adobe Flash
plugin or running update-command-not-found you no longer need to "chmod
-x /usr/local/bin/curl".

* Manpages for scripts, which come with Whonix.

* /etc/whonix.d/ and /etc/whonix_firewall.d/ .d style configuration folders.

* Deactivate the kgpg tray icon by default (#10), not perfect, but less
confusing, since it will now hopefully start in foreground

* Boot Clock Randomization

* Time Sanity Check

* Downloading Tor Browser and signature from
http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/dist/torbrowser/linux instead from
https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser for better security when run
inside Whonix. (Not sure if we can keep this, due to upstream weaknesses
with hidden services scaling.)

* Tor Button's New Identity button now functional. (Thanks to Control Port Filter Proxy.)

* optional Time Privacy wrapper

* enable "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" by default (but didn't enable
enforce mode or added any useful profiles)

* moved blog to wordpress.com, better than sourceforge, because
wordpress.com supports SSL, closed #23

* Tor Browser is now system default browser, when trying to open links it will ask for confirmation to avoid accidental linking (configurable).

* too many other improvements under the hood in git log
